# Verilog Code Repository

Welcome to the Verilog Code Repository! This repository contains a collection of Verilog modules, testbenches, and simulation files for digital design projects. These designs range from simple logic gates to more complex components like ALUs, FSMs, and CPUs.


## 🛠️ Requirements

To work with the files in this repository, you need the following tools:

- **Verilog Simulator** (e.g., Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, or Vivado)
- **GTKWave** (for waveform viewing)
- **Text Editor or IDE** (e.g., VS Code, Vivado, or Quartus)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/verilog-code.git
   cd verilog-code
   
3. Compile Verilog code using Icarus Verilog:
   iverilog -o output.out src/your_module.v tb/your_module_tb.v

4. Run simulation:
   vvp output.out

6. View waveform (if applicable):
   gtkwave dump.vcd

   

📚 Contents

src/: Contains the main Verilog modules.

tb/: Includes testbenches for verifying each module.

sim/: Output files from simulations and waveform files.

docs/: Block diagrams, flowcharts, and design documentation.

📌 Notes

1. Each module is self-contained with a corresponding testbench.
2. All modules are written in Verilog HDL and follow standard coding conventions.
3. Please refer to individual module comments for functionality.
